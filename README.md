# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health metrics using machine learning models like **SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting (GBDT)** with **Robust Scaler** for feature scaling. The app is built with **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface.
